### 1. Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
### 2. Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
### 3. Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
### 4. Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
### 5. When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
### 6. When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.

#### This is done in React and it also uses several react libraries.
